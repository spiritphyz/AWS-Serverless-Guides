# AWS-Serverless-Guides
**Infrastructure guides for hosting secure, static sites on Amazon Web Services**

The purpose of these guides is to allow developers unfamiliar with the AWS platform to set up a secure static site using static site generators like GatsbyJS. The site contents are served with auto-renewing HTTPS certificates and are duplicated on a CDN for fast delivery.

To become familiar with the areas of control and customization, you will be given specific instructions on where to customize options in the GUI-based Management Console. In the latter half of the guides, you will be shown how to accomplish many of the tasks through CLI-based terminal commands.
